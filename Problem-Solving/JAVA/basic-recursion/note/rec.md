## why recursion
- It helps us to solve complex problem using recursion
- you can convert recursion solution into iteration(loops) vice versa
- Space Complexity ( each call store in STACK !!!) is not constant

-  IF we draw recursive tree we know there is two branches left and right
- The execution start from left side then it moves into the right side of the tree

### Variables in Recursion (VVI)
-
- Arguments
- Return Type
- Body of the Functions

## Problems
-
-
- if we call rec problem we see , in the some times it repeat again and again
- we solve the  repeated problem using DYNAMIC PROBLEM (DP) solutions
